This directory contains a boilerplate React environment configuration.
Development-related scripts have been defined within package.json.

Create a custom hook that fetches GIF data from Giphy's developer API (https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI),
and make use of this hook within the "App" component found within index.js.
The API should be queried for "dog" GIF data. The data returned by the API should be rendered within the 
"pre" element with the id of "response-container", found within the "App" component.

The custom hook should return some means of tracking loading state. While an async-request is loading, 
the component using the custom hook should display a "Loading..." message.

The custom hook should return some means of identifying if an error has occurred during the fetching of
data. If an error has occurred, the component using the custom hook should display an "Error" message.

A minimal implementation of the loading and error messages mentioned above is fine, don't spend time on
specialised styling or animations for loading and error states.

Additionally, write some tests to ensure that the custom hook functions as required, and supports the
tracking of loading and error states.
